- [web](https://github.com/zestyxyz/ads-sdk/tree/main/web)
- [wonderland](https://github.com/zestyxyz/ads-sdk/tree/main/wonderland)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo and run `yarn` at the top level. This repo is set up with yarn workspaces, so doing this will install modules for all of the different SDKs.
- Work on whichever SDKs are relevant to you.
- Run `yarn build` at the top level to build all the SDKs at once.
- Run `yarn test` to run unit tests.
  - (Optional) Run `yarn prepare` to set up a pre-commit hook to run tests.

## Publishing to NPM

If you've developed a new framework SDK and want to publish it to NPM, the steps are as follows:

- Ensure you are a member of the zestymarket org on NPM.
- Ensure that the name in the package.json for the SDK follows the `@zestymarket/<framework>-sdk` format.
- In the directory for that SDK, run `npm publish --access public` and the SDK will be published to the zestymarket NPM org.
